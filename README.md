So the folder inludes;
 the server which hosts the socket. 
 the client which shows the client interface. 
 the users.txt, the external storage for all users. 
    -With a cap at 3..so either you remove the existing clients, or you remove the cap. 
    - As it is it can handle more than 3 but for testing sake i used 2.

For how the server;
    -I have commented out all the necessary information when it comes to the requirements on the assignment.
    - to run it; 
        -> open terminal(if using vscode look it up) or just do { Ctrl + ` } -  Control key + back-tick key, the back-tick key is usually found right below the escape key.
        -> add the command 'python server.py'
        -> select the split terminal option - On that terminal window, that thing that looks like a window/open book next to the trashcan icon. Usually on the top rightside of the terminal window(You can't miss it)
        -> then to the new terminal add the command 'python client.py'
        -> Follow the prompts, the showcase of how it operates is easy. Just get a third terminal and you can chat. 

#dict - users -> at line 15 of server.py
     - active_clients -> at line 20 of server.py
#list - valid_choices -> line 31 of client.py
#Authentication - as from line 35-75 of server.py
